## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  


My name is Edward, I am a CS graduate with a bachelor's degree. I have a passion for exploring the latest technology, libraries, tools, and everything in between. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to dive in and learn something new.
