## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  


My name is Edward, I am a CS graduate with a bachelor's degree. I have a passion for exploring the latest technology, libraries, tools, and everything in between. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to dive in and learn something new.  


Currently working on 2 projects: SelenicSpark3 web app (C#) and [Ez_Flux.1](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/Ez_Flux.1) - lightweight Python Flux.1 shell. 


Main, "SelenicSpark" project has 3 stages: 
1. Boxed: ASP.NET/MVC + internal in-memory DB + out-of-box Auth services ([ref](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp)) // complete
2. Modular: AngularTS + .NET WebAPI (swagger) + MySQL ([ref-front](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp_v2_Angular), [ref-back](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp_v2_WebAPI)) // abandoned - lost interest
3. Clustered: ReactTS + .NET WebAPI microservices + PostgreSQL ([ref](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp3)) // in progress


I'm mostly sharpening my skills in web app development (ASP.NET). Yet, I'm not limiting my research to .NET C#, but also expanding my knowledge in the Python field. Nothing in particular though, just another automation tool.
