## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  


My name is Edward, I am a recent CS graduate with a bachelor's degree. As a rookie developer, I have a passion for exploring the latest technology, libraries, tools, and everything in between. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to dive in and learn something new.  


Currently I'm working on [SelenicSpark web application](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp). First stage of the project has been completed, and I'm trying to move from old MVC architecture to more modern styles, like modular/microservices.  


I'm sharpening my skills in web app development (ASP.NET). However, I'm not limiting research to C#, I'm also expanding my knowledge in the Python field, particularly in areas, related to web development (back-end).  


*Thank you for visiting my Github profile. Feel free to browse my projects and connect with me on [Telegram](https://t.me/hardcoremagazine) or by leaving an issue on this repository.*
