### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edward, and I am a recent CS graduate with a bachelor's degree. As a 'rookie' developer, I have a passion for exploring the latest technology, libraries, tools, and everything in between. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to dive in and learn something new.

Currently, I'm working on [SelenicSpark web application](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp). First stage of project has been completed, and I'm trying to move from old MVC pattern to modern architectures, like microservices.

As dedicated student of programming, I'm constantly learning and growing. I'm currently sharpening my skills in **web app development (ASP.NET)**. However, I'm not limiting research to C#, but also expanding my knowledge in the Python field, particularly in areas, related to web development (backend).

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. Feel free to browse my projects and connect with me on [Telegram](https://t.me/hardcoremagazine) or by leaving an issue on this repository.
